Welcome to the “Advanced Application of JavaScript” project! In this project, you will build a dynamic To-Do List application that allows users to add, display, and remove tasks. This project focuses on utilizing advanced DOM manipulation techniques to interact dynamically with the webpage.

You will learn how to:

Select and manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript.
Attach event listeners to handle user interactions.
Persist data using localStorage, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the browser is closed.
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional To-Do List application that demonstrates your understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and your ability to create dynamic web applications
